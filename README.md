Progress meter for long-running operations in Julia

## Installation

Within julia, execute
```julia
Pkg.add("ProgressMeter")
```

## Usage

### Progress meters for tasks with a pre-determined number of steps

This works for functions that process things in loops or with map/pmap:

```julia
using ProgressMeter

@showprogress 1 "Computing..." for i in 1:50
    sleep(0.1)
end

@showprogress pmap(1:10) do x
    sleep(0.1)
    x^2
end
```

The first incantation will use a minimum update interval of 1 second, and show the ETA and final duration.  If your computation runs so quickly that it never needs to show progress, no extraneous output will be displayed.

The `@showprogress` macro wraps a `for` loop, comprehension, or map/pmap as long as the object being iterated over implements the `length` method and will handle `continue` correctly.

You can also control progress updates and reports manually:

```julia
function my_long_running_function(filenames::Array)
    n = length(filenames)
    p = Progress(n, 1)   # minimum update interval: 1 second
    for f in filenames
        # Here's where you do all the hard, slow work
        next!(p)
    end
end
```

For tasks such as reading file data where the progress increment varies between iterations, you can use `update!`:

```julia
using ProgressMeter

function readFileLines(fileName::String)
    file = open(fileName,"r")

    seekend(file)
    fileSize = position(file)

    seekstart(file)
    p = Progress(fileSize, 1)   # minimum update interval: 1 second
    while !eof(file)
        line = readline(file)
        # Here's where you do all the hard, slow work

        update!(p, position(file))
    end
end
```

### Progress bar style

Optionally, a description string can be specified which will be prepended to the output, and a progress meter `M` characters long can be shown.  E.g.

```julia
p = Progress(n, 1, "Computing initial pass...", 50)
```

will yield

```
Computing initial pass...53%|███████████████████████████                       |  ETA: 0:09:02
```

in a manner similar to [python-progressbar](https://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/).

Also, other properties can be modified through keywords. The glyphs used in the bar may be specified by passing a `BarGlyphs` object as the keyword argument `barglyphs`. The `BarGlyphs` constructor can either take 5 characters as arguments or a single 5 character string. E.g.

```julia
p = Progress(n, dt=0.5, barglyphs=BarGlyphs("[=> ]"), barlen=50, color=:yellow)
```

will yield

```
Progress: 53%[==========================>                       ]  ETA: 0:09:02
```

### Progress meters for tasks with an unknown number of steps

Some tasks only terminate when some criterion is satisfied, for
example to achieve convergence within a specified tolerance.  In such
circumstances, you can use the `ProgressThresh` type:

```julia
prog = ProgressThresh(1e-5, "Minimizing:")
for val in logspace(2, -6, 20)
    ProgressMeter.update!(prog, val)
    sleep(0.1)
end
```

This will display progress until `val` drops below the threshold value (1e-5).

### Printing additional information

You can also print and update information related to the computation by using
the `showvalues` keyword. The following example displays the iteration counter
and the value of a dummy variable `x` below the progress meter:

```julia
x,n = 1,10
p = Progress(n)
for iter = 1:10
    x *= 2
    sleep(0.5)
    ProgressMeter.next!(p; showvalues = [(:iter,iter), (:x,x)])
end
```

### `progress_map`

More control over the progress bar in a map function can be achieved with the `progress_map` and `progress_pmap` functions. The keyword argument `progress` can be used to supply a custom progress meter.

```julia
p = Progress(10, barglyphs=BarGlyphs("[=> ]"))
progress_map(1:10, progress=p) do x
    sleep(0.1)
    x^2
end
```
